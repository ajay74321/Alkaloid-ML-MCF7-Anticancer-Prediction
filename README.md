# Alkaloid-ML-MCF7-Anticancer-Prediction
A machine learning project developed to predict the anticancer potency of alkaloid compounds against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The workflow includes data extraction, preprocessing, molecular descriptor generation, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation to identify the most reliable predictive model for alkaloid activity
